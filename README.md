### Circuit Logic

Core:

1. :books: _[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319)_, Nov. 2017

   This is kinda a book that tagarts for any layman, but it becomes complicated after mentioning flip-flop. I read this again in Feb 2019, after I have learned more on assembly from Nand2Tetris.
   
   I would like to recommend this book to my child when he/she comes to age, as a introductionary book for programming.

   This is an amazing experience to learn about how to build a computer using chips. I wish I would have time to build this when I got enough time.
