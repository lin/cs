#### Chapter 4: Processor Design

4.1 Introduce a new ISA called Y86. (RISC, CISC)

4.2 Gates, ALU, Memory and Clock. Too little information. Talking too fast.

4.3 Implement this ISA using circuit logic. Introduce **FDEMW** stages, and sequential process

4.4 **Pipeline** Principles

4.5 Implementation of Pipeline

#### Chapter 5:

Skipped. Read after all others have been read.

#### Chapter 6: Memory Hierarchy

6.1 Kinds of Physical Memory Device

6.2 **Locality** (Less Jump through memory)

6.3 **Hierarchy**, the main topic of this chapter

6.4-6.6 **Cache** and how to write better code on cache

#### Chapter 7: Linking

A very small chapter, several sections are just one page long.

Things happened after assembly.

Relocatable object file --- Static Linkers ---> Executable object file

Symbol Resolution & Relocation (final memory address is determined)

#### Chapter 8: Exceptional Control Flow (OS)

A prerequisite for operating system.

8.1 what is exception and classes of exceptions

8.2 **process**

#### Chapter 9: Virtual Memory

9.1 Introduction to VM

9.9 **Allocation**

9.10 **Garbage Collection**


#### Chapter 10: IO

Only 20 pages, quite small chapter.

#### Chapter 11: Network

Not hard too. 30 pages long.

#### Chapter 12: Concurrent

50 more pages long. Hard topic to learn.

Process, IO multiplex, Thread
