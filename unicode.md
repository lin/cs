The first 128 chars are ASCII or Control Chars and Basic Latin, which is the most important part of the Unicode.

Among the first 128, the first 32 are control chars, notably:

`10, 0x000A` is New Line (NL) `\n`

`13, 0x000D` is Carriage Return (CR) `\r`

Among the first 128, the next 96 are basic latin, notably:

`32, 0x0020` is space, ` `. One of the most important charcodes.

`65, 0x0041` is A, before A are: `:;<=>?@`

`97, 0x0061` is a, after Z and before a are: `[\]^_\``, the diff between captital and lowercase letter are 32 or 0x20
