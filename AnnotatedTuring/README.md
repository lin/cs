In the paper, Turing proposed a machine which he argued is capable to do whatever a human computer could do.

And this machine has some limitations. Notably no machine can determine whether a given machine ever prints a zero or not.

But in first order logic (FOL), we don't have the limitation to construct such a formula (whether a machine ever prints a zero).

Then main argument goes: 

If we have a powerful mechanical procedure to determine whether a FOL is provable or not, we will encounter a FOL formula that describes the limitation of all mechanical prodedures.

That also means FOL is more expressive than mechanical procedures. It describes rather than solves.

FOL can describe this machine, as well as the properties of this machine. But some properties that are generically definable (also true specifically) are not computable.

The limitation or the constrait is basically the definable space is larger than the computable space. Hence the two different infinities.

An analogy:

Hilbert: Can we design a machine that solves every problems written in Chinese under seven characters?

Turing: All machine doesn't have the solution to how to live forever.

Turing: No machine can answer to the input: "如何长生不老？" (simply translate "how to live forever" to Chinese). 

Turing: So we can't design a machine that solves every problems written in Chinese under seven characters?

Turing: The set of all problems written in Chinese under seven characters is a SUPER SUPER HUGE set. 

Turing: It will be easy to find a problem no machine can answer but can be express under seven characters in Chinese.
